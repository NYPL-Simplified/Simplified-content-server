# Library Simplified Content Server

The Library Simplified Content Server is *DEPRECATED*. There is no need for anyone to install or run this software.

The original purpose of the content server was to host open-access content and publish it through OPDS feeds. All of this functionality is now part of the [Library Simplified Circulation Manager](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation).

If you are running a circulation manager, you can import a variety of high quality open-access content by creating a collection based on OPDS import, and setting the import URL to `https://circulation.librarysimplified.org/OPEN/crawlable`.
