"""Upload URNs from a CSV into a CustomList.

Using an input CSV file (usually generated from the `bin/util/csv_export`
command) the specified CustomList can be created new, appended to, or
replaced. 

This example replaces the "Banana-Specific Fiction" list with a
completely new group of Identifiers.

$ bin/util/upload_custom_list banana.csv "Banana-Specific Fiction" -rp

The CustomList can later be uploaded or downloaded as a static feed using
the `bin/util/create_static_feed_from_list` command.
